● the first line holds the room dimensions (X Y), separated by a single space (all coordinates will be presented in this format)
● the second line holds the hoover position
● subsequent lines contain the zero or more positions of patches of dirt (one per line)
● the next line then always contains the driving instructions (at least one)

## Example output:
Program output should be printed to the standard output (STDOUT) of the terminal (or equivalent in the browser, console.log())
● The first line of your program output should display the X and Y coordinates marking the position of the hoover after processing all commands.
● The second line of the program output should display the number of patches of dirt the robot cleaned up.

## Evaluation
The purpose of this exercise is for us to see some of the code you wrote and should be proud of. We will especially consider:
● Overall user experience
● Clarity of instructions
● Code organisation
● Code quality
● Code documentation
